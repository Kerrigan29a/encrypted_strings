INTRODUCTION
============
This project aims to study how to encrypt and obfuscate explicit text strings
used programs in C and C++. A common technique used to investigate into an
executable file, is to analyze these text strings to extract information.

```
$ ./simple_hello_world   
Hello world  
$ strings simple_hello_world   
>Hello world  
```

With the exposed technique in this project, a developer will "hide" those string.

```
$ ./hello_c  
hello world  
foo bar  
$ strings hello_c  
cnggd+|dygoahh'efu  
Utpc1cxry1spbepcu  
$ ./hello_cpp  
hello world  
foo bar  
$ strings hello_cpp

```
