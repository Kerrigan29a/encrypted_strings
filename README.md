# ENCRYPTED STRINGS

##INTRODUCTION
This project aims to study how to encrypt and obfuscate explicit text strings used programs in C and C++. A common technique used to investigate into an executable file, is to analyze these text strings to extract information.

```
$ ./simple_hello_world
Hello world
$ strings simple_hello_world
Hello world
```

With the exposed technique in this project, a developer will "hide" those string.

```
$ ./hello_c
hello world
foo bar
$ strings hello_c
cnggd+|dygoahh'efu
Utpc1cxry1spbepcu
$ ./hello_cpp
hello world
foo bar
$ strings hello_cpp
zPLR
cnggd+|dygoahh'efu
Utpc1cxry1spbepcu
```

## USAGE
To use encrypted strings, it's necessary to create a file `strings.list` with the following style

```ini
HELLO_WORLD = "hello world"
FOO_BAR = "foo bar"
RICH_BASTARD = "Dear rich bastard"
```

Then, in order to compile correctly the project it's necessary to execute the script `string_cypher.py` that generates the file `encrypted_strings.def` that has the following content:

```c
STR(HELLO_WORLD, 11, {'\x63', '\x6e', '\x67', '\x67', '\x64', '\x2b', '\x7c', '\x64', '\x79', '\x67', '\x6f', })
STR(FOO_BAR, 7, {'\x61', '\x68', '\x68', '\x27', '\x65', '\x66', '\x75', })
STR(RICH_BASTARD, 17, {'\x55', '\x74', '\x70', '\x63', '\x31', '\x63', '\x78', '\x72', '\x79', '\x31', '\x73', '\x70', '\x62', '\x65', '\x70', '\x63', '\x75', })
```

### C example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "encrypted_strings.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	/*
	 * Create a buffer for each string before any instructions has been
	 * executed (just like declaring local variables)
	 */
	ES_CREATE_BUFFER(HELLO_WORLD, hw);
	ES_CREATE_BUFFER(FOO_BAR, fb);

	/*
	 * Decrypt the strings
	 */
	ES_DECRYPT(HELLO_WORLD, hw);
	ES_DECRYPT(FOO_BAR, fb);

	/*
	 * Use them
	 */
	puts(hw);
	puts(fb);
}
```

### C++ example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "encrypted_strings.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	/*
	 * Decrypt the strings and use them
	 */
	ES_DECRYPT(HELLO_WORLD, hw);
	std::cout << hw << std::endl;

	ES_DECRYPT(FOO_BAR, fb);
	std::cout << fb << std::endl;
}
```

## INTERNALS
The obfuscation of the strings is made by a `xor` encryption over all the bytes of the string with the length of the string as the key. Additional the strings are stored as array of characters (without the last 0 byte) instead of C-style strings.
