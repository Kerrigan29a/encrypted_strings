# ENCRYPTED STRINGS

##INTRODUCTION
This project aims to study how to encrypt and obfuscate explicit text strings used programs in C and C++. A common technique used to investigate into an executable file, is to analyze these text strings to extract information.

```
$ ./simple_hello_world
Hello world
$ strings simple_hello_world
Hello world
```

With the exposed technique in this project, a developer will "hide" those string.

```
$ ./hello_c
hello world
foo bar
$ strings hello_c
cnggd+|dygoahh'efu
Utpc1cxry1spbepcu
$ ./hello_cpp
hello world
foo bar
$ strings hello_cpp
zPLR
cnggd+|dygoahh'efu
Utpc1cxry1spbepcu
```

## USAGE

### C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "encrypted_strings.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	/*
	 * Create a buffer for each string before any instructions has been
	 * executed (just like declaring local variables)
	 */
	ES_CREATE_BUFFER(HELLO_WORLD, hw);
	ES_CREATE_BUFFER(FOO_BAR, fb);

	/*
	 * Decrypt the strings
	 */
	ES_DECRYPT(HELLO_WORLD, hw);
	ES_DECRYPT(FOO_BAR, fb);

	/*
	 * Use them
	 */
	puts(hw);
	puts(fb);
}
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "encrypted_strings.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	/*
	 * Decrypt the strings and use them
	 */
	ES_DECRYPT(HELLO_WORLD, hw);
	std::cout << hw << std::endl;

	ES_DECRYPT(FOO_BAR, fb);
	std::cout << fb << std::endl;
}
```
